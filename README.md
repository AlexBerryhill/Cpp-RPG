# Overview

I know that C++ can be a powerful and fast language that will help me if I can master it. This is to test myself to make sure I understand most of what I need to know including classes reading files, lambda functions, and more.

## Description
This software is a puzzle game that is played in the console. The goal is to get the $, nut the walls are collasing in as you move. Try to plan your steps so you do not get trapped, and perhaps you can use it to get places you could not reach before.

I wrote this software because it can show a lot of concepts in a simple and easy to read package.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to program this game. Then you run it either through the console or VS Codes dev enviroment.

This is written in C++, The Header Files used are:
- iostream: to read and write to the console.
- conio.h: to use getch for fluid input.
- fstream: to read levels from files
- STL map: to tranlate what is on file to the display.
